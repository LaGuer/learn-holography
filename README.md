This repository will contain some notes, diagrams and animations
aimed at helping laymen understand the theoretical basis of holography.
You can access the current version of the tutorial here:
**http://waldir.github.com/holography-tutorial**

Requirements for mathematics, physics or signal processing background
will be kept as low as possible.
The goal is to maintain a highly accessible resource
for the curious layman.

**Note:** I make no claim of scientific accuracy
or otherwise correctness of this guide!
I'm still learning myself :)
Feel free to make suggestions or corrections,
either via issue reports or pull requests.
