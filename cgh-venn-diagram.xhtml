	<h2>CGH Venn diagram</h2>

	<p>This was an attempt at wrapping my mind around the great diversity
	of Computer-Generated Holography (CGH) techniques.
	There is a lot of variation, cross-polination, and hybrid models.
	This diagram is incomplete and most likely incorrect,
	but might help getting a rough initial idea about the CGH landscape.
	I will update it as my understanding improves.</p>
