    <h2>Wave propagation</h2>
    <p>Below are two charged particles, represented by green circles.
       Each charge affects the electrical field around it.</p>
    <p>If you click the particle on the left,
       an external force starts oscillating it.
       This causes changes in its electrical field
       to propagate outward, at the speed of light
       (of course, much slowed down for this illustration).</p>
    <p>When these changes reach the second particle (5 seconds later),
       they stimulate it into an identical motion pattern.
       The propagation distance makes such motion to occur with a slight delay
       compared to the original particle's.</p>

    <p>The wave "effect" caused by this propagation delay is clear
       once we observe what happens when several more particles
       are added to this setup:
       (click the first one to start the animation)</p>

    <p>Essentially, charged particles "drag" each other along,
       and the closer they are,
       the faster the influence of one reaches the other.</p>
